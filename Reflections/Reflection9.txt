For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

completion, i was getting file reading errors on my moleculeRenderer due to intellij not
having the correct working directory,

* What is the point of comparators?  Why are they necessary in general?
  Could you suggest an alternative way of solving the same problems that didn't
  involve having to make these additional classes?

  comparators are useful for compare things other than ints or doubles,
  making it easier to give objects order when they have no direct number assigned to them.

  the only other way i could think of solving this problem in another way would be to pit
  the checking code in methods rather than using the comparator, or add the comparator
  via a lambda expression

* Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
  testing.  Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.

- make all error messages easy to understand and meaningful
- test only one method at a time
- make smaller test methods to check certain errors rather than one big test method
to check all errors
