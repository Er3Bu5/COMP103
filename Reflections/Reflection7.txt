For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
respectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

completion, i struggled wth printPathToRoot because i forgot about using the parent node to recurse up the tree. once i realised this, was easy

* When you load in the same taxonomy from the file over and over again, you may notice that some times the tree is displayed differently. Why?

we are loading items from an unordered set, therefore the tree can have a diffrent order each time.

* In the inSubtree(...) method used in the completion, we try to ensure that if a node is moved (along with it's subtree), then it isn't 
moved into it's own subtree. Discuss two problems that could occur if we allowed a node (along with it's subtree) to become a child of one 
of the nodes in that subtree.

if you have a leaf node pointing to a root, you will have an infinite loop, therefore you wont be able to recurse past that loop. 
if you have a leaf node pointing to a parent node THAT IS NOT the root of the tree, a loop will be created that is disjoint from the 
rest of the tree, therefore that loop will be inaccessable from the rest of the tree.
