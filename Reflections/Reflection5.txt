For your reflection:
====================

First, describe how far you got, on this assignment. Please be specific about
what you attempted (core, completion, challenge, and any finer-grained goals,
if applicable). Please also state how successful you believe you were
espectively. If there were any problems you got stuck on, what were they?

Sometimes a recursive method can alternatively be written just using simple
loops. What do think determines whether this is possible or not? 

What are the advantages/disadvantages of using recursive methods rather than
loops?

Many people find recursion hard to understand at first, although it doesn't do
anything different from previous programs - it just involves methods which call
methods.  Why is it tricky then?

--------------------------------------------------------------------
finished up to completion, got everything working. got stuck on the randomness for mondrian, 
i used a decimal to calculate in place of percentage from 0.25 to 0.75, meaning i had to cast 
the operand as a double to get it working as expected within an int equation, i used shorthand
'd' to make it more clear instead of the %ff method or putting a '.0'

you can write any recursive method as an iterative one, so it really all comes down to the 
circumstance. in some situations an iterative approach may be benificial, or 
easier to code in comparison to a recusive one, and there are other situations where the 
opposite is true. an example of a situation being better in a recursive form; the fibonacci 
sequence.

pros:
recursive methods are usefull for reducing the time complexity of the program, 
also it makes navigating trees easy.
con:
uses more of the system stack to do so.

i find recursion difficult because you have to think about how the variable will change over 
each iteration, and seeing as it will be the same code over every iteration of the method, 
you need to put more thougt into your code.
