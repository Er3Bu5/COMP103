For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (i.e. anything in the lectures to date, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

I found the spiral challange to be quite difficult, but then i realised that first i needed to populate a 2d matrix.
From here i recalled an engr123 lecture about traversing through graphs using the coordinates of their verticies and create wer. I applied this concept and thaught of an algorythm where i could create a spiral 'path' for each index to be sorted into in a sequential order. Then it was the usual taks of drawing out the matrix via the same method as in the square method.
